            No. of trials : 15

    Second: set the game settings according to the game level:
        set the guess to a number within the limits using random module
        set the number of trials: n_trials

    Finally: Play the game:
        Ask the user to guess the number:
            If he guessed it successfully : print('Congratulations, you achieved it in {user_trials} trial') 
            if he failed:
                user_trials < n_trials: till him (Increase) or (Decrease)
